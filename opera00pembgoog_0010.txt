Tun aim of the Publishers, in this edition os Horace,
has been to meet the growing demand for Annotations
on theClassics,1n Enomsn. In the general esti·
mate, the advantage of the scholar sunda before
the interest of the master. Latin notes can, it is

obvious, in the work of instruction, be of utility

only to the toacher-the lesmor, boy or manis in

no condition to reap the benefit of them; and boys,
in particular, are too easily repulsed by difficulties,
to force their way through so formidabis an obstruo·
tion. It is notorious, indeed, that they scarcely
ever make the attempt. There will still be teachers
to deprecate this innovation upon established prac-
tice3 but to advance to the unknown through the

known is the dictate of common sense-as applicable
